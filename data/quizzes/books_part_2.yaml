  - prompt: |
      Describe with a couple sentences what a __retention schedule__ is, in regards to public records (Chapter 4: Art of Access). Feel free to include a few examples.


  - prompt: |
      Given a table named `people` that looks like this:


      | name   | age    |
      |--------|--------|
      | Blair  |  40    |
      | Dani   |  60    |
      | Egon   |  20    |
      {:.table-sql}

      Write a SQL query that selects from the `people` table and ends with this resulting table:

      | age    |
      |--------|
      | 60     |
      {:.table-sql}


  - prompt: |
      Same table and format as the previous question, except write the query to get this result:

      | avg_age    | peeps |
      |------------|-------|
      | 40         |   3   |
      {:.table-sql}

      Hint: it requires a couple of aggregation functions and aliasing. But no `GROUP BY`.
