points: 10
type: Homework
due_date: 2016-10-13
assigned_date: 2016-10-11
deliverables:
  - In your `padjo-2016` folder, create a new spreadsheet named `muckrocks`
  - The `muckrocks` spreadsheet should have one tab named `completions`, which should document 5 requests on MuckRock that were completed and are interesting to you.
  - The `muckrocks` spreadsheet should contain a second tab named `rejections`, which should document 5 requests on MuckRock that were rejected.
requirements:
  - Follow the schema in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/165qUmZZCRFc8f_TLF-RxI4uYXJnW4hiab7ptOMw0E6k/edit#gid=0)
  - For the `completions` tab, try to browse around for requests for information that you didn't realize were public record. Try to expand upon what you already know to be public record.
  - For the `rejections` tab, I want you to list the specific reasons/exemptions for the rejection. List the law/code that the responder cites, and briefly explain the reason in your own words.
  - Try to pick a variety of agencies at different jurisdictions, to get more exposure to the subtle differences between states and locales.

# About MuckRock

MuckRock is a non-profit service that helps users file and track public records requests. As a side effect, requests that go through MuckRock are published for everyone else to see, including not just the results of the request, but all the intermediary communication.

This makes MuckRock a great resource for learning how to do public record requests, whether you need just state-specific boilerplate to copy, or you're looking for inspiration on what to ask for.


## Browsing requests on MuckRock

Start your browsing of MuckRock here: [https://www.muckrock.com/foi/list/](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/list/).

On the left side of the page is a box of filter options. Use it to filter for __Completed__ or __Rejected__:

## Reading a MuckRock request

Each MuckRock request has its own page, and depending on the complexity of the request, the page will have a lot of subsections.

Let's look at this example: [1122 Vehicles delivered to CO Auto Dealerships](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/colorado-127/1122-vehicles-delivered-to-co-auto-dealerships-20193/)

The default view is to show all of the __Communications__. The top message is the initial request, by Daniel Welch on August 5, 2015, in this case:

For most completed requests, the very last message usually contains the response with file attachments, which you can download and examine on your own:

Sometimes the files are scattered across various messages, as the agency delivers the information over a period of time and negotiation. At the top of every request page is a __Files__ tab, which provides a convenient listing of the sent files:
