    In your `padjo-2016` folder, create (or [just copy mine](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UgWuZZiQg-dFBjLlqnKX1Nlyv6vV699JmPIvK6zgg7g/edit#gid=818785383), but empty and rename it) a new spreadsheet named `foia-log`

  - The spreadsheet should have two tabs, __requests__ and __receipts__
  - At a minimum, it should have the schema in the example explained below.

One of the ongoing requirements for this class is for you to have sent 10 public records requests. The first few, like the FBI FOIA, are just warmups to get acquainted with public records. By the end of the quarter, you should have a indepth story/beat (from another class), and you should know the topic well enough that writing 6-or-more related records requests will be trivial. And if the requests succeed, you'll have documents and data for your actual story/project.


> <strong>Note</strong>: This assignment uses "FOIA" as a generic term for public records requests. At the state level, it's not called "FOIA", and the exemptions and response-time requirements are different, as you will soon find out.

Ten requests is more than enough to lose track of, which is why services like [MuckRock exist](https://www.muckrock.com/).

For now, we don't need to use MuckRock, we just need a lightweight way to track what we've done. The easiest way to do that is with a spreadsheet. And it's a good way to practice data management while doing something useful -- helping to keep track of our work.


You can copy the example I have here in my [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UgWuZZiQg-dFBjLlqnKX1Nlyv6vV699JmPIvK6zgg7g/edit#gid=0). It consists of two separate sheets, __requests__ and __receipts__, explained in further detail below.

This log is meant to help _you_. You should include the fields I have at a minimum, but feel free to include more columns as necessary. And fill out the fields in ways that make sense to you. Part of assignment is practice using the spreadsheet as a powerful note-taking tool, with many benefits to come later down the road.

For this assignment, you just have to create the sheet and add the FBI request that you made in the previous assignment. We'll add more requests as the weeks continue.




# The `requests` sheet

This is straightforward: every request you make, create a new row in this sheet. By the end of the quarter, there should be at least 10 rows.


Here's a screenshot of my example ([which can be accessed on my Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UgWuZZiQg-dFBjLlqnKX1Nlyv6vV699JmPIvK6zgg7g/edit#gid=0))

Here's an explanation of the fields:



|       fieldname        |                                                                     description                                                                      |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| title                  | A human-readable label for your request, e.g. Paul Newman's FBI File                                                                                 |
| description            | What exactly you're asking for, e.g. "All text messages sent by San Jose City Council Members between June 4 and June 10, 2016"                      |
| precedent              | A short blurb and/or URL of a similar request you've seen, or something that inspired you to make this request                                       |
| status                 | Just a word to indicate at a glance where things are at, e.g. "Just sent" or "Waiting"                                                               |
| respondent_entity      | Name of the agency contacted, e.g. "FBI" or "Menlo Park Fire Protection District"                                                                    |
| respondent_person      | Name and title of person handling your request, e.g. "Jane Parker, City Clerk"                                                                       |
| request_page_url       | If the agency has a homepage for information about their records, link it here for reference                                                         |
| date_sent              | Date the request was first sent, in YYYY-MM-DD format, e.g. `2016-11-09`                                                                             |
| date_response_expected | According to the relevant open records law, the date that your request has to be fulfilled. Make sure you count only business days if that's the law |
| date_acknowledged      | Date when you got a formal reply. Typically, this means getting a request number, not just an auto-reply                                             |

# The `receipts` sheet

This one's a little trickier if you've never worked with a database. The __receipts__ sheet is a log of all the correspondence received during the lifetime of a request. This includes the first acknowledgment to whatever they finally end up sending you, including a rejection notice.

In other words, this sheet attempts to document a _many-to-one_ relationship: One request, many responses.

One request could have just a couple of responses. Another could have 10. this means that we can't use the standard flat-table arrangement.

Instead, we loosely follow what Hadley Wickham calls, ["Tidy Data"](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html), in which every "observation" has its own row.

This makes the data harder to read because of the repetition and non-left-to-right-flow of information. 

Here's a screenshot of my example __receipts__ table ([see it on Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UgWuZZiQg-dFBjLlqnKX1Nlyv6vV699JmPIvK6zgg7g/edit#gid=818785383)):

However, tidy data lends itself to being easily summarized and analyzed. To get a concise view of the response history to a request, we just create a simple pivot table.

This pivot table below shows how many receipts I've gotten for each request, and the earliest and most recent date of correspondence:

<img src="images/my-receipts-pivot-example.png" alt="my-receipts-pivot-example.png">

Here's an explanation of the fields:




|  fieldname   |                                         description                                          |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| title        | The same title you used in the __requests__ sheet. Should be _exact_                         |
| date         | The date when you received the record/message                                                |
| type         | What kind of message was it, generally speaking? e.g. "Acknowledgment", "Delay"              |
| details      | A short blurb about what you received                                                        |
| relevant_url | A URL pointing to the message/document you were sent. Typically, a file in your Google Drive |
{:.table.table-condensed.table-bordered}




The data entry will feel a little awkward because typically, this kind of granular record keeping is done by software and databases. But doing a little of this by hand will make it much easier to understand the power of database join and aggregation queries. Plus, it's not so hard if you know how to Ctrl-Copy-Paste.
