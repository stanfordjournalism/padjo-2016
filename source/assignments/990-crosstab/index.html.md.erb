points: 10
type: Homework
due_date: 2016-10-04
deliverables:
  - |
    In your `padjo-2016` folder, create a new spreadsheet named `990-compare`.
  - |
    Create a word document named `990-analysis` that consists of a few paragraphs of interesting things you found, e.g. "It was interesting to see that the Harvard Crimson's drop in advertising revenue was less steep than the Yale Daily News"
requirements:
  - |
    The `990-compare` spreadsheet should have 5 rows, one for each nonprofit
  - |
    Besides a column for __name__ and the "Employer Identification Number", tt should have 6 columns, indicating 6 __numerical__ data points that you have extracted for each non-profit, e.g. number of employees, current year contributions and grants, salary of chief executive officer.

    Create two columns that are derivations of the 6 columns you've manually data-entered. It can be simple as a ratio, such as net revenue divided by total revenue.

- [America's 50 worst charities rake in nearly $1 billion for corporate fundraisers](http://www.tampabay.com/topics/specials/worst-charities1.page)
- And skim through some of the related stories in the Worst Charities project:

The reporters behind the "Worst Charities" helpfully provide an annotated 990 to show the things they look at for red flags, e.g. the amount spent on [professional fundraising](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1202643-kidswishnetwork_990_2011_annotated.html#document/p1/a163883). Use it as a guide just to see what kind of things you can learn overall from a 990, regardless if you're looking for financial problems.
