title: Cataloging Google's Self-Driving Car Accidents
due_date: 2016-09-29 
due_time: 1:30 PM
description: |
  A warm-up of spreadsheet basics, data-entry prowess, and the very hard task of turning unstructured information into structured data.
points: 10
deliverables:
  - |
    In your __padjo-2016__ folder on Google Drive, create a new spreadsheet named: __google-auto-accidents__ (exact spelling and capitalization)
  - |
    The __google-auto-accidents__ spreadsheet should contain a single sheet with at least these fields:
    
    - `narrative` (optional, but highly recommended)
    - `year`
    - `month`
    - `day`, e.g. `1`, `31`
    - `mode`, e.g. `auto` or `manual`

  - |
    The __google-auto-accidents__ spreadsheet should have at least __3__ more columns of your choosing that you think would be useful when analyzing the accident data, such as the nearest `city` where the accident took place.

# Questions to have in mind

- Who many times was the Google driver at fault?
- How many accidents involved the vehicle in autonomous mode?
- Type of damage?

# Examples

- [Official homepage of Google self-driving reports](https://www.google.com/selfdrivingcar/reports/)
- [Silk Visualization of partial accident data](https://google-self-driving-car-incidents.silk.co/)
- [Google self-driving car gets rear-ended in 13th accident since 2009](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/06/google-self-driving-car-gets-rear-ended-in-13th-accident-since-2009/)



# Reports

Here are all the reports to read. There's a lot of them, so aim for _efficency_:

- The accident narratives are in roughly the same place in each report
