Consider this reading to be done over the days before Thanksgiving break, over break, and into the Thursday of Week 9. 

Questions will focus on the big picture things, less so about trivia. Try to finish the books by the beginning of Week 9. I'll have more specific questions to freshen up on before the actual quiz, which will be mostly multiple-choice and some short-answer.

Examples:


###### Describe what a "pended" case is, in this context:

> Nonetheless, Goodin’s ruling creates another kind of problem: A case in which the pathologist’s finding is being pended is not, to the police department’s way of thinking, a murder. And if it isn’t a murder, it doesn’t go up on the board. And if it isn’t up on the board, it doesn’t really exist. Unless the primary detective takes it on himself to pursue a pended case, it has every chance of falling through the cracks the moment that detective gets a call that is a murder.


###### Similarly/alternatively, describe the dilemma of the Carol Wright case to someone who hasn't read the book.

> There's a standing ruling of a homicide, yet no criminal charge would ever be filed. "As far as the board was concerned, the Carol Wright case still wasn't a murder and therefore it didn't exist."



###### Explain in your own words the following phenomenon observed by Michelle Kimball and its practical effects on successful public records requests:

> Processing requests is perceived by many as processing widgets for the good of the bureaucracy, not democracy.


###### What the hell does empathy have to do with filing public records requests?
