description: |
  Ryan Shapiro is a Ph.D. candidate at MIT and a research affiliate at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. He is an historian of national security specializing in governmental transparency and the policing of dissent. Politico has referred to Shapiro as “a FOIA guru at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology”, while the FBI has declared Shapiro’s FOIA research methodologies themselves to be a threat to national security.  

  Shapiro will speak to us about his research and journey from animal rights activist to FOIA-powered-scholar and transparency activist.
