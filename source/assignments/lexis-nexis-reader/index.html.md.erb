title: LexisNexis That Story
description: |
  For an investigative story that you've read, use LexisNexis to do 5 queries, to find 5 more stories of at least 500+ words, from 5 different years and publications that have insights/context not found in the investigative story you read.
assigned_date: 2016-10-04
due_date: 2016-10-06
due_time: 1:30 PM
points: 5
deliverables:
  - "Use the `document-story-sources` spreadsheet from the other assignment, and add a new tab."
  - "Do 5 queries on LexisNexis, and find 5 stories that relate to the investigative story you've read."
  - See the sample spreadsheet below to see the expected schema.
requirements:
  - "The 5 stories should be from publications different than the original story. Try to find stories from before the investigative story."
  - |
    "For every query, log the search terms in your query, fromdate, todate, and number of results"
  - "From each query, pick one relevant story of 500+ words and read it"
  - "Log its date, headline, publisher, wordcount"
  - "Jot a few notes of insights you got from the story"
  - Meh just look at the sample spreadsheet below to see how things are ordered.

This is the second part to the [assignment involving an investigative story to read and document](/assignments/document-story-sources). This time, you're looking at what this story came after. Or before.

The purpose of this exercise is twofold:

1. Get some experience searching for things on LexisNexis. [Here's a short tutorial I wrote for class](/tutorials/lexis-nexis-just-try-it/).
2. Understand that there is nothing completely new, but learn from other's work and past investigations.


As an example, I read this story from [Reuters: The Deadly Epidemic America is Ignoring: The Uncounted](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-uncounted-surveillance/). It might be helpful to read the story (it's good!) and see how I mapped it to my sloppy spreadsheet.

And here's [the 5 stories on LexisNexis I found, on my Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16e_S8Y6kewRBNbjH9Cep7hGnHv25QvweK9RA53gXS94/edit#gid=503738853).


Here's a screenshot:

Note that the point of logging the query/search term is for your own informational purposes. You don't have to switch it up...but...why not?

In terms of what stories are relevant to your main investigative story...the [nail salon story in the New York Times was a blockbluster](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/nyregion/nail-salon-workers-in-nyc-face-hazardous-chemicals.html), and something that most people hadn't really seen in terms of a blowout investigation. That doesn't mean that the health of nail salon workers wasn't ever written about. Doing a LexisNexis query for `nail salons AND (safety or visa)` brings up stories such as "For Asian nail salons, EPA's lesson translates; With a large Vietnamese presence in the trade, a seminar treats chemical safety in their own tongue" via the Philly Inquirer, and "Human trafficking case centers on York County nail salons" via the York Dispatch.
