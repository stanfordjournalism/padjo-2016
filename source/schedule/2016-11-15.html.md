  - title: The difficulty of data cleaning
    description: |
      Even with all our proficiency in SQL and spreadsheets, the most difficult challenge remains: data-cleaning (or, "wrangling"). Naming things and cache invalidation are the two remaining and intractable hard problems in computer science, and it isn't any different for computational journalists.
  - title: Officer-involved shootings
    description: |
      The fact that several news organizations are running their own tallies of U.S. police-involved shootings, or that one of them has won 2 Pulitzers for doing so, or that, for many years, no one was keeping track, should foreshadow the real-world cost, variance, difficulty, and reluctance in counting even something that seems straightforward and vital to society.
