# Hullo

Besides the two agenda items listed above, I'll be talking broadly about the goal and expectations of the course, particularly what can be found on the [Assignments](/sssignments) and [Syllabus](/syllabus) pages, as well as the two assignments due on __Thursday__:

- [Homework: Cataloging Google's Self-Driving Car Accidents](/assignments/google-car-crash-reports/)
- [Homework: First FBI FOIA Letter](http://localhost:4567/assignments/first-fbi-foia/)

I'll have more formal notes up later this week. Sorry for the delay.
