  - title: Researching the Past with Lexis-Nexis
    description: |
      As a Stanford student, you have free access to Lexis-Nexis, which can be an even more powerful tool for finding relevant news stories than Google.
  - title: Text is Data
    description: |
      "Data" is not the result of some magical file format. We can create spreadsheets from plaintext using delimiters. Understanding delimiters will go a very long way in realizing how dumb and limited the computer is, which is absolutely essential in surviving the next few weeks of database programming.
  - title: Spreadsheet Visualizations
    description: |
      Making visualizations from data inside a spreadsheet is pretty easy. The core concept is that the data fits the form of the spreadsheet. Not coincidentally, database tables have that exact form and propensity to be easily visualized.
  - title: Expanding a story through research
    description: |
      Several major assignments will require you to dig up as many sources, documents, and articles about a topic of your choice. We'll have an in-class brainstorming session on how to take a local topic -- say, EpiPpens in Palo Alto schools -- and find dozens of sources and angles to pursue, locally and nationwide.
