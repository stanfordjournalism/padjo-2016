This past week, I failed at completing a massive re-write of the tutorials from last year's class. So for today, I have lots of datasets, and lots of hands-on problems. I hope to wrangle all the words and code I've written up to use as a reference when you're doing your final projects for this class. But I think we can learn a decent amount just by going through Carto in class.

# Download the data

[Go to this page](/tutorials/carto-sql-fast-intro/data-downloads), copy all the URLs, and upload them to your CartoDB account.

Last year's tutorials have the same concepts, it's just that the buttons are in a different place:

- [Joining crime data to NYPD precincts to create a choropleth map in CartoDB | Public Affairs Data Journalism at Stanford University](http://2015.padjo.org/tutorials/mapping/022-joining-crime-data-to-nypd-precinct-map/)
[- How to map both the quantity and change of NYPD precinct-level crime data | Public Affairs Data Journalism at Stanford University](http://2015.padjo.org/tutorials/mapping/033-cartodb-adding-multiple-layers-to-show-diffs-by-precinct)

- [Creating a multi-layered CartoDB map of Census household incomes and Starbucks locations in NYC | Public Affairs Data Journalism at Stanford University](http://2015.padjo.org/tutorials/mapping/044-census-household-income-2000-with-starbucks/)
