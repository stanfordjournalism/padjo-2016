  - title: "SQL Syntax: GROUP BY and HAVING"
    description: |
      Remember Pivot Tables? We can get aggregate values over groups in SQL, too.
  - title: "SQL Aggregate Functions"
    description: |
      Averages, sums, counts, and so forth.
  - title: "SQL Subqueries"
    description: |
      Every result of a SQL query is another table. Which means we can query a result to perform even more specific, powerful searches.

  - title: LEFT JOINs
    description: |
      It's hard enough to find by hand the matches between two datasets, even harder to find what's *missing*. However, `LEFT JOINs` make these kinds of queries and investigations as easy as any join.
  - title: Common Table Expressions with `WITH`
    description: |
      Basically, another way to express sub-queries
  - title: Indexes
    description: |
      With indexes, we can boost the speed of a database query by order of magnitude. All it takes is knowing the `CREATE INDEX` syntax, and understanding exactly what we're trying to (usually) find.

    description: |
      For the most part, we've learned how to *select* data. So let's learn how to `CREATE` tables, `INSERT` new rows, and `UPDATE` them, even though it isn't a priority for the midterm, but at some point, you'll want to learn how to create a database from a spreadsheet, and how to move between the two systems to use each to their best advantages.

  - title: SQL JOIN Statements
    description: |
      A lot of powerful journalism is simply looking at one list and seeing which of its names are on another list. The `JOIN` clause is the clearest way to express that concept, and to execute it in a blink of an eye. It is the main reason why we learn SQL instead of trying to hack around the usually versatile spreadsheet.
