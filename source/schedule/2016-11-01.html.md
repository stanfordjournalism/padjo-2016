title: JOINS, finally?

  All about JOINs, my favorite part about SQL. We'll cover the syntax, I'll try to show them in real-life exercises. And we'll have plenty of homework on it for next week.

# All about joins??

I apologize, I spent way too much time gathering datasets for use in join-exercises that I didn't get a chance to revamp how I explained the topic. The past lessons work fine, I just would rather have them be more topical:

- 2015: [An introduction to joins and INNER JOINs](http://2015.padjo.org/tutorials/babynames-and-college-salaries/030-all-about-inner-joins/) -- on second thought, this one was a bit meta.
- 2014: [Basic SQL Inner joins](http://www.padjo.org/tutorials/database-joins/sql-inner-join/) -- this one is nice, the main drawback is that it's written in MySQL, though the differences are few.

The [homework assignment for today is a long walkthrough with most of the answers done for you](/assignments/sql-exercise-salary-gender-joins/). There's also a lesson (that needs editing) [on using the babyname data to join gender data to Hollywood Reporter's 100 Most Powerful List](/tutorials/sql-joins-example-thr-power-gender), to make it trivial to see the gender imbalance.






# Joins as a boring fact of the data world

JOINs, as a way to bring data together, are necessary because real-world systems find it more efficient to separate data into separate systems. We've seen a low-level version of this with the [SF restaurant scores database](/tutorials/sqlite-data-starterpacks/#toc-san-francisco-restaurant-health-inspections), which separates data for businesses, inspections, and violations into separate tables.

If I have access only to `businesses`, then I have access only to boilerplate information.

~~~sql
SELECT * 
FROM businesses
WHERE name LIKE '%STARBUCKS%';
~~~

While `violations` has a lot of the interesting dirt, it has none of the context we need for discerning the safety of businesses. We get only violation descriptions, connected to meaningless numbers:

~~~sql
SELECT *
FROM violations 
WHERE description = "High risk vermin infestation";
~~~

<img src="/tutorials/all-about-joins/images/sf-vermin-violations.png" alt="sf-vermin-violations.png">


What would make the two nearly-useless tables interesting? If we could put the text of the violation next to the name of the business that failed in food safety. And that's all a JOIN does:

# Joins in journalism

That said, the concept of JOINs in a commercial/enterprise system isn't often exciting. In the following SQL query:

~~~sql
SELECT *
FROM violations 
INNER JOIN 
  businesses 
  ON businesses.business_id = violations.business_id
WHERE description = "High risk vermin infestation"
AND name LIKE '%STARBUCK%'
~~~

How did I know to join on `business_id`? Because that's the way the system was designed. Doesn't take much creativity, and there's not much else choice.

But in journalism, there aren't ready-made systems. Journalists have to think of ways to JOIN different datasets, and the JOIN is not as clean as it is in a tech company's database system.

But the tradeoff is that there are many ways to surprise people who can't think outside of a database. But learning `JOINS` is very useful, even if most of your work is not in SQL. It's a very concise way to describe how data, events, and facts can be connected.

The syntax isn't the easiest thing, but it more than pays off.
