  - title: Pivot Tables
    description: |
      A bit cumbersome to learn, but by far the easiest way to get the big picture of any spreadsheet-sized dataset. The concepts here carry directly into database concepts later.
  - title: The unreliability of spreadsheets
    description: |
      The conveniences and power that make spreadsheets an everyday data tool can often make them harmful in larger data-diving situations.
  - title: San Francisco's EnCampment Database
    description: |
      This spreadsheet is actually the output of a database used by the City of San Francisco to manually track reported homeless encampments. The data it contains is small enough for us to get an idea of how complicated data structures need to be to accurately model what we intend to track in real-life.
  - title: FOIA of FOIAs
    description: |
      Every time you send a records request, that becomes a record, too. So exercise your right to public records *and* mooch off of other people's work and insights.
  - title: California S.B. 272
    description: |
      California's state and city agencies publish a lot of data. But a law requiring them to publish catalogs of everything they have makes it much easier to see what's *not* yet published.
