  - title: Introduction to Databases, Structured Query Language, and SQLite
    description: |
      Think of everything you've learned about spreadsheets and prepare to vastly simplify it by first learning how to command a database. These next 3 weeks are focused on learning the SQL language and concepts while working with datasets too big for spreadsheets.
  - title: "SQL Syntax: SELECT, LIMIT, ORDER, and aliasing column names"
    description: |
      Databases don't just show us their data. Unlike spreadsheets, we have to know exactly what data we want and how we want it arranged, and we have to declare it through SQL code.
  - title: Reading Your Browser's History with SQLite
    description: |
      How the SQLite database is used in billions of real-world applications today is of little relevance to us in this class. But the web browser is a easy-to-understand scenario of how a database gets created and filled.
