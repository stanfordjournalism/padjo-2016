  - title: More Real World Dirty Data
    description: |
      Covering more challenges of real-world data. Data without structure is just noise, after all.
  - title: Crime Data
    description: |

  - title: (Not Small but not quite) Big data approach to the SF Encampment Database
    description: |
      The official database of encampments is small and outdated, due to the nature of the data collection. What are datasets that we could process and analyze to implicitly find where homeless encampments have been reported and/or neglected by the city.
