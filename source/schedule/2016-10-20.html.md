# Homework

Sorry for the informal writeup. 


I didn't write a different GROUP BY tutorial for this year. These are still relevant in terms of the same code:

- [Aggregate functions in SQL](http://2015.padjo.org/tutorials/sql-aggregates/aggregate-functions-in-sql/)
- [Using GROUP BY to create aggregates in SQL](http://2015.padjo.org/tutorials/sql-aggregates/group-by-in-sql/)



## Requirements: Two SQL analyses-visualizations due

Make a spreadsheet named `sql-to-spreadsheets`. It will have to sub-sheets.

Send me an email with:

- The question, in normal English, that you were trying to answer.
- The SQL query you wrote.

#### First sheet

Pick [a dataset from here](/tutorials/sqlite-data-starterpacks). You can look around on your own, but I don't want you to get stuck on hiccups in the importing process.

Read about the data (even if it means Googling around)

Write a query that has these at least 3 of these components:

- Selects specific columns (don't use `*`)
- Filters the data using a `WHERE` clause.
- Sorts the result by some field or condition
- Limits the results to something useful.

#### Second sheet

Same thing as the first sheet, but pick a different dataset. This time, include a `GROUP BY function`.


#### Example query

An example: Using the [Pensinsula city salary data](http://localhost:4567/tutorials/sqlite-data-starterpacks#toc-salaries-of-city-officials-from-the-california-peninsula), group the data by city name and year, produce a list of average salary, by city and year, in sorted in ascending order of city name and year.
