> "What the Sun Sentinel has done is a service to all police agencies because if they did not know they had a speeding problem, now they do...I, like most chiefs around, if you ask them everybody's going to tell you, `We didn't know it was this bad'"

-- Miami police Chief Manuel Orosa, as quoted in, [36 Miami cops to be punished, Sun Sentinel](http://www.pulitzer.org/works/2013-Public-Service); June 5, 2012.
