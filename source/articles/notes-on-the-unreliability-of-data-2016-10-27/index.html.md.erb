Mr. Shilts, to give him credit, does not overstress Mr. Dugas’ role. (But he does identify Dugas, and does not cite the Auerbach and Darrow paper.) Elsewhere, however, “patient zero” has been used extensively in marketing the book and its various spinoffs, and the story is still being used. Most recently California Magazine, which serialized the episode from the book, took a half-page advertisement in The New York Times in which it ran Mr. Dugas’ photograph over text beginning: “The AIDS epidemic in America wasn’t spread by a virus. It was spread by a single man…. A Canadian flight attendant named Gaetan Dugas….” This is a rather nasty phenomenon.

The real criminal in the case of Patient Zero is not Gaétan Dugas but the spread of half-truths as fact. Blaming Randy Shilts doesn't serve a purpose, either. Writers aren't God. We are fallible and we are not always aware when our own demons leap onto the page, invisible to us but crystal clear to others.

[H.I.V. Arrived in the U.S. Long Before ‘Patient Zero’](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/27/health/hiv-patient-zero-genetic-analysis.html)

> In the tortuous mythology of the AIDS epidemic, one legend never seems to die: Patient Zero, a.k.a. Gaétan Dugas, a globe-trotting, sexually insatiable French Canadian flight attendant who supposedly picked up H.I.V. in Haiti or Africa and spread it to dozens, even hundreds, of men before his death in 1984.

> Mr. Dugas was once blamed for setting off the entire American AIDS epidemic, which traumatized the nation in the 1980s and has since killed more than 500,000 Americans. The New York Post even described him with the headline “The Man Who Gave Us AIDS.”

# Who destroyed his name?

Let's get this out of the way: it was easy to libel Gaëtan Dugas because by the time Dugas was revealed, he had already died. Being a gay man before gay marriage was allowed,

So who is to blame?

## Investigative San Francisco Chronicle journalist Randy Shilts

He was the author of [And the Band Played On](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_the_Band_Played_On). He did the work to identify Shilts:

<img src="images/band-played-on-patient-zero.png" alt="band-played-on-patient-zero.png">

[Richard McKay, in 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4046389/), retraced Shlits' research. McKay points out that Shlits' was aware before 1987 of studies showing that AIDS had a longer incubation study, which would cast doubt that Dugas was a likely origin. In 1993, Shlits claimed that he knew the difference between `O` and `0`:

> Nonetheless, the storytelling potential of the cluster study’s central figure captivated the reporter, who later explained, “In the middle of that study was a circle with an O next to it, and I always thought it was Patient O. When I went to the CDC, they started talking about Patient Zero. I thought, Ooh, that’s catchy.


No one disputes the power of Shilits' investigative reporting. If anyone should have known better, it was him.

## His publisher

> "Don't blame Randy. Blame me," says Michael Denneny over the phone from his New York office. Denneny is the editor at St Martin's Press who worked with Shilts on And The Band Played On. Around the time the advance publicity for the book went out to the media, Newsweek ran a story on AIDS. Consequently, the major papers told the publisher that they would not be covering And The Band Played On. That AIDS had been "done."

> Denneny asked a crackerjack publicist who used to work for St. Martin's Press to read the book and see if he could a find a hook that would grab the media's attention. The publicist came back with one idea: focus the PR material on Gaétan Dugas and the Patient Zero story. 

> "It's the worst kind of yellow journalism. I admit I got my hands dirty," says Denneny, today. "Randy was horrified. He didn't want to do it but I pointed out to him that if we didn't no one would read the book and we'd sell 5,000 copies that would end up collecting dust on the shelves."

> However, when the evidence given is examined in detail the cluster dissolves. There are nine of the forty pairs in the cluster for which the time between the alleged exposure and the onset of AIDS symptoms is given; in three of these both the alleged infector and the alleged infectee had onset of symptoms at about the same time; in six more the mean time from sexual contact to symptoms is eleven months. As we now know, the probability of clinical disease within two years of infection is extremely rare and the average time is on the order of eight to ten years: thus it is highly probable that none of these nine reported contacts was in fact responsible for the alleged transmission. No date is given for the other thirty-one contacts but they must be regarded as equally suspect.

## Old news

Back in 2013: https://web.archive.org/web/20131001155405/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/survivingandthriving/education/higher-education-patient-zero.html

As early as 2013, the NIH was posting complete guides to the controversy:


https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/survivingandthriving/education/higher-education-patient-zero.html


> The search for a “Patient Zero”—popularly understood to be the first infected case of an epidemic—has been an important feature of the news media’s coverage of disease outbreaks from the late 20th century onward, including HIV/AIDS, Ebola, SARS, and H1N1. Yet despite its widespread use, the term is a recent invention, drawing its origins from epidemiological studies investigating the etiology of AIDS in the United States in 1982. How did the idea of an epidemic’s “Patient Zero” so swiftly come to exert a strong grip on the scientific, media, and popular consciousness?


> https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/survivingandthriving/education/higher-education-patient-zero-class3.html
> 
> In 1981, the recognition in the United States of a seemingly new and often fatal disorder—noticed first amongst gay men and later seen amongst injection drug users, blood product recipients, and some Haitian immigrants—led to the involvement of epidemiological investigators from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). In a series of studies, the CDC attempted to unravel the complex medical, social, and environmental factors that might have placed these individuals at increased risk for the condition, which by mid-1982 had become known by the acronym AIDS. One investigation, the 1982 Los Angeles cluster study, attempted to trace sexual connections among a number of gay men residing in California who were amongst the earliest reported cases of AIDS in that state. A non-Californian man with Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS)—a type of skin cancer often used as a way of diagnosing AIDS before the discovery of a causative retrovirus—was linked as a sexual contact to four of these patients. This individual’s status as the “Out-of-California” patient was originally abbreviated to the letter “O,” which in turn was given additional resonance when researchers read this as the number “0.”

https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/survivingandthriving/education/higher-education-patient-zero-class4.html

> In addition to entertaining the possibility that Dugas may have been “the person who brought AIDS to North America,” the journalist became convinced, albeit on highly questionable evidence, that this French-Canadian flight attendant had been determined to spread his disease deliberately. When his editor feared that the national media’s unwillingness to review Shilts’s book would leave it unsold in warehouses, a plan was set in motion to promote the book with a news story that suggested Dugas, whom the journalist rechristened as “Patient Zero,” had triggered the epidemic in America. Newspapers around the world followed the New York Post 's lead, and in November 1987, tens of millions of television viewers tuned in to a 60 Minutes news special which reproduced Shilts’s claims and profiled Dugas as “a central victim and victimizer” of the American epidemic.


http://www.dailyxtra.com/ottawa/news-and-ideas/news/ga%C3%A9tan-dugas-and-the-aids-mary-myth-9266

> Dugas did cooperate along with many others on a CDC study, that much is certain. On several occasions The CDC paid for his airline tickets and hotel rooms. It is possible Dugas could have been Patient Zero but we'll never know. Even if he was, Patient Zero does not mean what some people think it means. A chart was drawn to connect the dots of men who'd had sex with one another, starting in California. The "hub" dot was someone labelled Patient O, as in the letter "O" from "Out of California." At some point O became Zero, for the sake of convenience. It is not a variation on ground zero nor does it mean zero as an indicator of the first case. The term Patient Zero is completely arbitrary. Zero means nothing. 


--------


> Following the recognition of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s, epidemic disease re-emerged as a serious global health issue, a concern which stretches into the early 21st­century amidst anxieties of a world increasingly connected through air travel, trade, and immigration. Newly emerging diseases, like Ebola, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and swine flu (H1N1), as well as familiar but resurgent ones like tuberculosis, have drawn heightened scrutiny, and a focus on an epidemic’s “patient zero” is now a well-established feature of a response. True to the imprecise origin of the term itself, “patient zero” has come to be used interchangeably as a synonym for both the epidemiological “index case”—the first case to come to investigators’ attention—and the “primary case”—the earliest known individual to become infected.

> Since the early days of the AIDS epidemic, researchers have reasoned that a handful of people -- maybe even a single individual -- bore the unknowing responsibility for having introduced the disease to North America and its first large group of victims, the homosexual community. By tracing sexual contacts, officials at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta in 1982 found a likely candidate: one man who, through his sexual liaisons and those of his bedmates, could be linked to nine of the first 19 cases in Los Angeles, 22 cases in New York City and nine more in eight other cities -- in all, some 40 of the first 248 cases in the U.S. The CDC acknowledged his role with an eerie sobriquet: it called him Patient Zero.

>  Randy Shilts's "Patient Zero," a French Canadian airline steward, plays this
 role in the recently published And the Band Played On (1987). Being openly gay
 did not prevent Shilts from devising this highly marketable narrative pivoting on
 the treachery of a single (now dead) man infected with HIV. Shilts's treatment of
 Gaetan Dugas collapses the young man's entire life into his sexual habits with an
 avidity and prurience tailor-made for the mass media. The media, in turn,
 dutifully reported the "Patient Zero" story as if its discovery of this single early
 "carrier" resolved the problem of blame, so central to the construction of AIDS
 as a moral issue.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_case

> Since the early days of the AIDS epidemic, researchers have reasoned that a handful of people -- maybe even a single individual -- bore the unknowing responsibility for having introduced the disease to North America and its first large group of victims, the homosexual community. By tracing sexual contacts, officials at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta in 1982 found a likely candidate: one man who, through his sexual liaisons and those of his bedmates, could be linked to nine of the first 19 cases in Los Angeles, 22 cases in New York City and nine more in eight other cities -- in all, some 40 of the first 248 cases in the U.S. The CDC acknowledged his role with an eerie sobriquet: it called him Patient Zero.

> By the time that Shilts was writing his book in 1986, however, researchers had extended the incubation period for AIDS from several months to several years of asymptomatic infection.37 This extension cast doubt on the significance of many of the links depicted in the cluster diagram and any inference that “patient 0” played an important role in the sexual network under study.38 Indeed, Shilts himself had written an article acknowledging this longer incubation period in 1985.39 Nonetheless, the storytelling potential of the cluster study’s central figure captivated the reporter, who later explained, “In the middle of that study was a circle with an O next to it, and I always thought it was Patient O. When I went to the CDC, they started talking about Patient Zero. I thought, Ooh, that’s catchy.


“It’s funny,” a thirty-six-year-old Randy Shilts mused while reflecting about Dugas in a 1987 interview with the Advocate, the prominent American gay newsmagazine. “He was the one person in the book I wasn’t looking for. He just appeared. Everywhere I turned in doing the research, his figure arose.”25 The Iowa-born and Illinois-raised journalist had drafted his proposal for a book on AIDS in May 1985, while reporting full-time on AIDS for the San Francisco Chronicle. Devastated by the toll that the epidemic was taking on his adopted home of San Francisco and convinced that widespread homophobia was impeding an effective response, Shilts decided that a book chronicling the first years of the epidemic might represent the best chance of a political intervention on the national stage.26 Following rejections from several publishers, the project was narrowly approved by St. Martin’s Press, with which Shilts had released his first book, The Mayor of Castro Street: The Life and Times of Harvey Milk, in 1982. The publisher granted him an advance of sixteen thousand dollars for travel and expenses, funds that he quickly depleted through extensive long-distance telephone interviews.27

> Another proclaimed goal for Band was to name names. Interviewed in 1987, Shilts remarked, “I feel that the problem with the epidemic now—and a reason for the hysteria—is that so much about AIDS has remained so mysterious. The medical literature will talk about an individual as Case A or Patient Zero, and it doesn’t give that person the dimension of being really human. I felt that by saying these are flesh-and-blood people with real names, I would bring home the reality of the epidemic and make it far less frightening.”32 The irony of this statement is remarkable, given the caricature of Gaétan Dugas that would emerge from his book.

Worobey's research shows that by the late 1970s, nearly 7 percent of gay men in New York City were infected with HIV, and nearly 4 percent in San Francisco were infected.

By the time Dugas caught HIV, there were many people infected in the U.S., maybe even thousands of people, Worobey says. And the HIV sequence taken from Dugas' blood looks very similar to these other sequences. There's nothing special about it, Worobey says.

What's with those scare quotes?

> 1970s and ‘Patient 0’ HIV-1 genomes illuminate early HIV/AIDS history in North America

> Reports of one cluster of homosexual men with AIDS linked through sexual contact were important in suggesting the sexual transmission route of an infectious agent before the identification of HIV-1 (refs 5, 11). Beginning in California, CDC investigators eventually connected 40 men in ten American cities to this sexual network. Investigators placed one man with Kaposi’s sarcoma near the centre of a sociogram representing this cluster and identified him as ‘Patient 0’—a ‘non-Californian AIDS patient’ and a possible ‘carrier’ of an infectious agent (Extended Data Fig. 7). Before publication, Patient ‘O’ was the abbreviation used to indicate that this patient with Kaposi’s sarcoma resided ‘Out(side)-of-California.’ As investigators numbered the cluster cases by date of symptom onset, the letter ‘O’ was misinterpreted as the number ‘0,’ and the non-Californian AIDS patient entered the literature with that title12. Although the authors of the cluster study repeatedly maintained that Patient 0 was probably not the ‘source’ of AIDS for the cluster or the wider US epidemic, many people have subsequently employed the term ‘patient zero’ to denote an original or primary case, and many still believe the story today13. We therefore recovered the complete HIV-1 genome of Patient 0 and examined it against the backdrop provided by the 1970s sequences.

> On the family tree of the early U.S. isolates, Dugas's HIV genome fell in about the middle. “There's nothing special about his genome,” Worobey said. Although Dugas had been to Haiti—in 1977—there is no sign that he was either the index patient or key to spreading the virus around the country. Worobey notes that when CDC researchers were piecing together how the first AIDS cases were linked to each other, they originally referred to Dugas not by the number “0” but by the letter “O,” because he was from “outside” California. Later, for reasons that remain murky, Dugas morphed into Patient Zero.




> Most compellingly, the language used by one commissioner demonstrated the way in which the term “patient zero,” originally coined as an epidemiological term to denote the Los Angeles cluster study’s nonresident case of KS, had evolved over only a few months of widespread public discussion to become synonymous with Shilts’s portrayal of Dugas as the dangerous disease spreader. Dr. Theresa Crenshaw, a sex therapist and one of the commission’s more socially conservative members, presented a justification for focusing on a small number of dangerous individuals. She had recently read that 5 percent of the “carriers,” for sexually transmitted diseases other than AIDS, were responsible for 80 percent of the cases. This meant, she reasoned, “that a very sexually active small group has an enormous impact on our society.” She continued, employing a telling choice of words: “We’re hearing such emphasis on the rarity of the patient zero or some of the individuals that you’ve alluded to, that have been prosecuted, whether they’re rare or whether they’re not rare we really must act promptly and effectively to prevent many others from becoming infected as a result of antisocial behavior.”105

------------

In 1990, the U.S. Congress passed the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act, which incorporated many of the Presidential Commission’s recommendations, to direct relief to the areas of the country most affected by HIV. Among its many provisions, the act required that states have in place “adequate” criminal laws to address the threat of intentional HIV transmission in order to receive federal grants.111 By the end of the 1990s most states had in their statutes some form of legislation that addressed the deliberate transmission of HIV—an often feared, though seldom demonstrated phenomenon. This controversial approach was subsequently transferred internationally to several west African countries, through the process of “model HIV law,” where ready-made legal frameworks were exported abroad as part of U.S.-funded development aid. This process has been linked as an important factor in recent efforts to further criminalize the transmission of HIV.112 Thus, not far below the surface of contemporary global HIV politics lurks the legacy of Randy Shilts’s depiction of Gaétan Dugas. 


---------

Worried that the mainstream media might not give coverage to Shilts’s popular history, his editor at St. Martin’s Press, Michael Denneny, approved a bold publicity strategy. He focused on Shilts’s identification of Dugas as “Patient Zero” and the flight attendant’s conflicts with physicians and public health officials, sensing that the salacious story the journalist had created would prove irresistible. His hunch was accurate: the New York Post’s headline on October 6, 1987, epitomized the media’s response and characterized the popular memory of Gaétan Dugas from that point on. “the man who gave us aids” read the front page, claiming that Dugas “triggered ‘gay cancer’ epidemic in U.S.”76 Other publications drew upon the frequently rehearsed narrative of a disease introduced from abroad by a foreigner. “Canadian Said to Have Had Key Role in Spread of AIDS,” wrote the New York Times, while the National Review nicknamed Dugas “the Columbus of AIDS.”77 Several Canadian newspapers like the Toronto Star adopted a more cautious tone, suggesting that “MDs doubt claim Canadian carried AIDS to continent.

Patient 0 and O

http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature19827.html#ref5

> Although labelled as the cluster study’s ‘index patient’, Patient 0 was neither the first AIDS case to come to CDC researchers’ attention, nor the first to display symptoms. In general, the CDC numbered cases in the order that the reports reached the agency from different cities and employed the terms ‘cases’ and ‘patients’ interchangeably. Patient 0, until he was linked to the cluster and took on his new name, was Case (or Patient) 057. The cluster study’s LA 6 was the CDC’s Case 032, and several cases in the New York section of the cluster5 (Extended Data Fig. 7) were also reported before Patient 0 (and thus brought to investigators’ attention first): NY 3 was Case 001, NY 2 was Case 002, NY 6 was Case 010 and NY 5 was Case 053 (ref. 14).
