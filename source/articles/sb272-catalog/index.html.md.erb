    California's state and city agencies publish a lot of data. But a law requiring them to publish catalogs of everything they have makes it much easier to see what's *not* yet published.

# The Encampment database

One of the interesting public records requests I've seen lately [came from Parker Higgins in late August 2016](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/san-francisco-141/san-francisco-encampment-database-27910/):

> The "enCampment" data system maintained by GSA-Public Works, described in SF OpenData records as "Tracking homeless encampment location and timeframes." Specifically, a record layout for the database and a data dictionary for any codes used in the database.

What SF Public Works returned was pretty much a spreadsheet, and you can see it here on [my Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b8eHUNQ1eeeDcPnAhF01KvRn3HYEOZHr7E7vucdZuho/edit#gid=587114326). It's just a multi-tab spreadsheet -- next we'll look at what makes it a database.


# SB 272

How did Higgins learn that the city has beta software to record homeless encampments? Through the power of SB 272: [Transparency Hunters Capture More than 400 California Database Catalogs](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/08/transparency-advocates-collect-more-400-database-catalogs)

California has a law that requires all jurisdictions to release catalogs of what records and software they have. Civic hackers put together a convenient spreadsheet of how to find these catalogs; [here's my mirror on Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ov_vyZnd7A9bM_kMqUU5d1NvWt4IzyGJGDZogQi4nx4/edit#gid=1713121581)

And here we can see the Encampment database:
