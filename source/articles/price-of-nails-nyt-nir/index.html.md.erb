  In New York City, manicures are inexpensive for customers but come at a high price for workers. The New York Times found that nail salon employees work for very low wages or for nothing, usually after paying a fee to be hired. Sarah Maslin Nir, who spent a year investigating the story, talks to Judy Woodruff about how nail salons have gotten away with illegal and unhealthy working conditions.

What I like about this story:

- 13 Month investigation
- Outside of her beat
- Outside of her language
- Exhaustive
- Show's reporting skill of listening, even in another language
- how to move when you have no records
- Followup

What's not to like: Plenty of questions about details and documents, even accounting for the inherently nebulous state of documentation.

>  Q. Linda Cronin-Gross: How did you get the workers to trust you enough to reveal such very personal and potentially damaging info about themselves?

> A. I worked with fabulous translators and reporters who interpreted our interviews. We would spend a lot of time not asking the questions we wanted answers to, just listening. The workers wanted to tell their stories, because they never had been able to. Quiet listening and respect built trust.




http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/nyregion/at-nail-salons-in-nyc-manicurists-are-underpaid-and-unprotected.html

> Last year, the New York State Labor Department, in conjunction with several other agencies, conducted its first nail salon sweep ever — about a month after The Times sent officials there an inquiry regarding their enforcement record with the industry. Investigators inspected 29 salons and found 116 wage violations.



http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/01/nyregion/nail-salon-sweeps-in-new-york-reveal-abuses-and-regulatory-challenges.html

> From a regulatory perspective, the results of the inspections seem to tell a straightforward story of widespread abuses. Although the state’s plans to crack down on the industry were highly publicized, all but a dozen of the 230 salons whose investigations were closed by late last year were cited for violating at least one labor law.

> About 85 percent of the salons failed to maintain adequate payroll records, a violation of state law, making it by far the most common citation, according to The Times’s review. Without records, investigators had to accept whatever employees told them they were paid, usually in front of their bosses.


## The Starbucks index

Love this [chart](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2015/05/05/nail-salon-graphics/8c809ccf0964b0e732e359cd76d480a683c7063b/salons3-artboard-300.png). For people who don't pay attention to nail salons, here's a simple chart that helps you understand their presence:

# Aftermath

Besides the continued protests at the Times building, here's a few things that have happened in the months after the investigation's publish date:

- [Ventilation to Be Required in All New York Nail Salons](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/22/nyregion/ventilation-to-be-required-in-all-new-york-nail-salons.html)
- [Backed by Nail Salon Owners, a New York Legislator Now Fights Reforms](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/nyregion/once-behind-nail-salon-law-assemblyman-now-opposes-reforms.html)


The best thing I've read that follows Maslin Nir's investigation is an independent followup by the [Columbia Journalism Review's Chava Gourarie](http://www.cjr.org/investigation/new_york_times_nail_salon_investigation.php). Barring a shocking/scandalous revelation, it's safe to assume that the NYT will eagerly report on the positive effects of its investigation. Gourarie's 3,500-word article is largely favorable to Nir's work, but the indepth interview of salon workers and how they live day-to-day paints an authentic portrait of what a big news blast can and can't change to the people in the middle.



# The Pushback

I'm having trouble thinking of other NYT investigations that attracted so much pushback in protest and in words. More than a [year later](http://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/08/nail-salon-owners-are-still-protesting-the-new-york-times-004704), nail salon owners were *still* holding protests in front of the NYT building. For comparison, the [world-famous Occupy Wall Street protests lasted 2 months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Occupy_Wall_Street).

The most prominent rebuttal came from [Richard Bernstein](http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2015/07/25/nail-salons-new-york-times-got-wrong/), who is not only a former New York Times journalist, but with his wife, has owned and operated day spas for a dozen years in Manhattan. Unlike Nir, Bernstein and his wife are fluent in Chinese, and he attempted without success to find the same Chinese-language ads that Nir reportedly found: [What the ‘Times’ Got Wrong About Nail Salons](http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2015/07/25/nail-salons-new-york-times-got-wrong/)



The NYT's editors [replied in a press release](http://www.nytco.com/rebuttal-to-the-nybrs-article-on-nyt-nail-salon-series/), arguing that Bernstein has no ability to be objective on the topic, while pointing out that his inability to find the ads that Nir found proved little. 

Bernstein sent a second rebuttal a few days later: [Nail Salons: A Reply to the ‘Times’](http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2015/07/31/nail-salons-reply-times/)

## Reason's rebuttal series

Jim Epstein, over at  _Reason_ -- which is generally sympathetic towards the rights of business owners versus regulation -- wrote several extensive critiques of the nail salon series:

- [The New York Times’ Nail Salons Series Was Filled with Misquotes and Factual Errors. Here’s Why That Matters. (Part 1)](http://reason.com/blog/2015/10/27/new-york-times-nail-salon-unvarnished)
- [How The New York Times' Flawed Reporting on Nail Salons Closed Opportunities For Undocumented Immigrants (Part 2)](https://reason.com/blog/2015/10/28/new-york-times-nir-nail-undocumented)
- [The New York Times Says Working in Nail Salons Causes Cancer and Miscarriages. The Evidence Says Otherwise. (Part 3)](https://reason.com/blog/2015/10/29/nail-salon-health-cancer-miscarriage-nir)
- [The New York Times Just Inadvertently Repudiated Its Own Flawed Nail Salon ‘Expose’](https://reason.com/blog/2016/03/01/nail-salons-new-york-times-nir-labor)

## The Public Editor's thoughts

Another metric of how prominent and controversial Maslin Nir's investigation: Times Public Editor Margaret Sullivan wrote two columns about it:

- In July 2015, Sullivan reviewed the NYT's response to Bernstein and agreed with its strong defense of Maslin Nir's "impressive and admirable" work: [Criticism of 'Unvarnished' Brings a Strong Times Defense](http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/criticism-of-unvarnished-brings-a-strong-times-defense/)
- A few months later in November, Sullivan sat down with Maslin Nir's editors to hear their response to Reason's Epstein's criticism. Sullivan found their explanations regarding employment ads to be "particularly troubling". She also found "convincing" Epstein's argument that the NYT's claims aren't fully supported by the available studies [New Questions on Nail Salon Investigation, and a Times Response](http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/new-questions-on-nail-salon-investigation-and-a-times-response/).

Sullivan concluded that the Times "write further follow-up stories, including some that re-examine its original findings and that take on the criticism from salon owners and others — not defensively but with an open mind."





# Beyond New York

New York may be the nail salon capital, but it's unlikely to be the only place where they've been an issue with regards to labor and workplace safety laws.

Back in 2012, the Los Angeles Times [reported on a state investigation that found toxic chemicals in nail products claiming to be toxic-free](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/10/local/la-me-health-nail-salons-20120410). After the NYT's investigation, the [LAT wrote that its readers wanted to know more](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-how-safe-are-california-nail-salons-20150508-story.html). In August of 2015, the LAT covered a forum in Little Saigon [as nail salon workers spoke up on abuse and wage theft](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-nail-salon-rights-20150807-story.html). In April 2016, Gov. Brown signed [a bill](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/15-16/bill/asm/ab_2001-2050/ab_2025_cfa_20160411_100939_asm_comm.html) to increase education on labor laws, particularly in nail salons.

The NYT's investigation reached the national level as U.S. Senators Blumenthal and Schumer called on [OSHA to update safety standards at nail salons](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/risk-management/pages/osha-safety-nail-salons.aspx). In 2006, the [Seattle Post-Intelligencer](http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/health/article/Nail-salons-workers-clients-at-risk-from-toxic-1221426.php) covered an EPA-led initiative to study air quality in salons.
