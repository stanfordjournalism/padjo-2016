# FOIAing the artist formerly known as "The Artist Formerly Known as Prince"

In general with any public records request, you'll want to be sure to get the details right. This helps the records department perform an accurate search. It also reduces the number of reasons that they have nothing for you, because they may not tell you if the lack of records is because they couldn't find someone by that exact name, or, that they know who you really want but don't really feel like returning those records to you.

In the case of celebrities, there seems to be some leeway. A requester at [MuckRock asked for "Leslie Nielson's" file](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/fbi-file-of-leslie-nelson-278/) and the FBI responded with Leslie Nielsen's records -- it helped that someone already requested the records, apparently:

When someone at [MuckRock requested the records for the artist Prince](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/fbi-files-on-prince-25345/#comms), they weren't taking any chances:


> A copy of the FBI's files on the musical artist Prince Rogers Nelson.

> He was also known as Prince, The Artist Formerly Known as Prince, Jamie Starr, Christopher, Alexander Nevermind, The Purple One, Joey Coco, an unpronounceable symbol available for review at this URL: http://bit.ly/23LQkwh , O(+> and TAFKAP.


It's worth noting in the [FBI response](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2832983-Interim-Response.html#document/p1
) that a __FOIPA Request Number__ is given:

__1349521-000__

<img src="images/fbi-prince-interim-foia-response.png" alt="fbi-prince-interim-foia-response.png">

This number can be used  to query the [FBI's online status database](https://vault.fbi.gov/fdps-1/search-fdps).  Here's the status of MuckRock's request for Prince as of late 2016; apparently, many other people have made this request:
