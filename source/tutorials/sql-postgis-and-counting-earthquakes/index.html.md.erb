## What were the biggest U.S. earthquakes in 2015?


~~~sql
SELECT mag, id, time, place, longitude, latitude
FROM quakes
WHERE SUBSTR(time, 1, 4) = '2015'
ORDER by mag DESC
LIMIT 5;
~~~


~~~sql
SELECT mag, id, time, place, longitude, latitude
FROM quakes
WHERE SUBSTR(time, 1, 4) = '2015'
ORDER by mag DESC
LIMIT 1;
~~~




## Using aggregate functions to find biggest earthquakes per year


How do we find the biggest earthquake for each year?

Start by thinking of the simplest way: re-run the query above, over and over, for each year:

~~~sql
SELECT mag, id, time, place, longitude, latitude
FROM quakes
WHERE SUBSTR(time, 1, 4) = '2014'
ORDER by mag DESC
LIMIT 1;
~~~

If you're not a programmer, this is not at all a bad idea. If it was your job to compile this list for the years 1995 to 2015, you could do this copy-paste, and even export each result into a spreadsheet, in less than 5 minutes.

But you should also think that it doesn't feel *graceful*. There must be an easier way, right?

### Finding just the biggest magnitude using MAX

The answer is a little complicated, depending on how closely you want to stick to best practices. Let's pretend that we really do want to stick to best practice. And let's make our task simpler:

_Find the biggest magnitudes_. That is, just get the number, not any of the other details about the earthquake.

We can use SQLite's `MAX` aggregate function for this:

~~~sql
SELECT MAX(AG)
