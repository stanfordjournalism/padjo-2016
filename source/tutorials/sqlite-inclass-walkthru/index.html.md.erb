# Past walkthroughs

Tutorials from the past year: the dataset is different, but same concepts and syntax:


- [SELECTing rows FROM data tables](http://2015.padjo.org/tutorials/sql-basics/select-and-from/)
- [LIMIT and ORDER BY in SQL Queries](http://2015.padjo.org/tutorials/sql-basics/limit-and-order/)
- [Using the WHERE clause to filter data in SQL](http://2015.padjo.org/tutorials/sql-basics/where-clause-as-filter/)

See if you can walkthrough this example: again, different database, but basically the same data: [Baby steps with SQLite and baby names data
](http://2015.padjo.org/assignments/baby-names-baby-sql/)


Datasets for this year can be found at: [SQLite Data Starter Packs](2016.padjo.org/tutorials/sqlite-data-starterpacks)

## Example of SF crime data

Download the data from here: [SFPD Incidents, 2012 through 2015](http://2016.padjo.org/tutorials/sqlite-data-starterpacks/#toc-sfpd-incidents-2012-through-2015)


Get a list of crime categories:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(category) FROM incidents;
```


Get the 10 most recent robberies:

```sql
SELECT * from incidents
WHERE category='ROBBERY'
ORDER BY datetime DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Get a group count of robberies and how they end up:

```sql
SELECT category, resolution, 
  COUNT(1) as "thecount"
FROM incidents
WHERE category='ROBBERY'
GROUP BY category, resolution
ORDER BY "thecount" DESC;
```
