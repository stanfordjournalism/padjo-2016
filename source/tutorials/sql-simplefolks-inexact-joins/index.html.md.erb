# Get the data

- Download the [simplefolks.sqlite data file](/files/data/starterpack/simplefolks.sqlite). 
- Preview it [as a Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12mwh5m0ryzK9fKPBtxGB9DRddzRefYVDt1AOrZJHLcE/edit#gid=0)

Once you've downloaded [simplefolks.sqlite data file](/files/data/starterpack/simplefolks.sqlite) onto your computer, open it with your SQLite client and be ready to write some queries.

## Simple politicians and inmates

- As of 2016, no one in either table is either incarcerated or in politics.
- No one served non-consecutive prison terms.
- No one was elected into non-consecutive terms. 
- At most, a politician has one prison term.
- At most, an inmate has one elected position.
- Not every inmate was/became a politician, and not every politician was/became an inmate.



# Queries

## Getting to know the inmates, individually

Let's start off with non-joining queries and practice our basic data filtering and sorting.

### List the 5 inmates in reverse alphabetical order of last name and first name, and in ascending order of birth year

SELECT last_name, first_name, birth_year
FROM inmates
ORDER BY

### List 3 inmates in order of shortest full name and alphabetical order

#### Complex

SELECT first_name, last_name, 
    LENGTH(first_name), LENGTH(last_name),
    LENGTH(first_name) +  LENGTH(last_name)
FROM inmates
ORDER BY 
  (LENGTH(first_name) + LENGTH(last_name)) ASC,
  last_name ASC, first_name ASC
LIMIT 3;

#### Minimalist

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM inmates
ORDER BY 
  (LENGTH(first_name) + LENGTH(last_name)) ASC,
  last_name ASC, first_name ASC
LIMIT 3;

#### Cleaner 1

SELECT first_name, last_name,
  (LENGTH(first_name) + LENGTH(last_name)) AS namelen
FROM inmates
ORDER BY 
  namelen ASC,
  last_name ASC, first_name ASC
LIMIT 3;


#### Concatenate to full name

SELECT (last_name || ', ' ||  first_name) AS full_name,
  LENGTH(first_name || last_name) AS namelen
FROM inmates
ORDER BY 
  namelen ASC,
  full_name ASC
LIMIT 3;



### Who had the longest prison term?


SELECT *, 
  (sentence_end - sentence_start) AS termlength
FROM inmates
ORDER BY termlength DESC
LIMIT 1


### Who was the youngest to be incarcerated?

SELECT *, 
  (sentence_start - birth_year) AS prisonage
FROM inmates
ORDER BY prisonage ASC
LIMIT 1

--------------


## Getting to know the inmates as a group

### How many inmates are there?

### What last names occur more than once?

### What is the oldest and youngest birth year?

### What is the average age of initial incarceration (rounded to nearest year)?

SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(sentence_start - birth_year)) AS avgprisonage
FROM inmates;




### What is the shortest, longest, and average length of sentence?

SELECT 
  MIN(sentence_end - sentence_start) AS minsentence,
  MAX(sentence_end - sentence_start) AS maxsentence,
  AVG(sentence_end - sentence_start) AS avgsentence
FROM inmates;


### List the count of inmates by length of last name


SELECT
  LENGTH(last_name) as lastnamelength,
  COUNT(*) AS icount
FROM inmates
GROUP BY lastnamelength
ORDER BY lastnamelength;

### List the count of inmates by birth decade

SELECT
  (SUBSTR(birth_year,1, 3) || '0') AS birthdecade,
  COUNT(*) AS icount
FROM inmates
GROUP BY birthdecade
ORDER BY birthdecade;


#### Is that a number?

SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS icount,
  (SUBSTR(birth_year,1, 3) * 10) AS birthdecade
FROM inmates
GROUP BY birthdecade
ORDER BY birthdecade;

------------------------

## Getting to know the politicians


### List the Whig politicians in order of position, state, and name

SELECT * FROM 
politicians
WHERE party = 'Whig'
ORDER BY position ASC, state ASC, last_name ASC, first_name ASC;



### Who was the youngest politician at the time of election?

SELECT *
FROM politicians
ORDER BY service_start - 

### Who was the oldest Senator at the end of their service?

### Who had the longest time in office?

### Which Whig spent the least time in office?


### Who spent the longest percentage of their life in office?

#### Most number of years

SELECT service_end - service_start  AS term_length,
  politicians.*
FROM politicians
ORDER BY  DESC
LIMIT 3;


#### As a percentage of total life


SELECT
  100.0 * (service_end - service_start) / (2016 - birth_year) AS office_pct,
  politicians.*
FROM politicians
ORDER BY office_pct DESC
LIMIT 3;


## Getting to know politicians as a group




### List the parties and number of politicians, in order of most politicians

SELECT 
  party AS party,
  COUNT(*) AS xcount
FROM politicians
GROUP BY party;

### List and count the politicians by party, state, and position

SELECT 
  party, state,
  COUNT(*) AS xcount
FROM politicians
GROUP BY   party, state
ORDER BY xcount DESC;

### Number of years served, total

SELECT SUM(service_end - service_start) AS years_served
FROM politicians;



### Number of years served, by party

SELECT party, SUM(service_end - service_start) AS years_served
FROM politicians
GROUP BY party
ORDER BY years_served DESC;


### Youngest and oldest age of election by party and position

And order it by oldest age


SELECT 
party,
position,
MIN(service_start - birth_year) AS youngest,
MAX(service_start - birth_year) AS oldest
FROM politicians
GROUP BY  party, position
ORDER BY oldest DESC;

### Count of, and years served, of Whig politicians by position

SELECT 
    position,
  count(*) AS pcount, 
  SUM(service_end - service_start) AS years_served
FROM politicians
WHERE party = 'Whig'
GROUP BY position

---------------------------

## Which politicians have been incarcerated?

### Joining politicians to inmates by name, lazily and naively

SELECT * 

### Joining politicians to inmates by name, naively

### Joining politicians to inmates, exactish

### Joining inmates to politicians

### Politicians who were later incarcerated

### Inmates who became politicians

~~~sql
SELECT * 
FROM inmates
INNER JOIN 
  politicians 
    ON  
      SUBSTR(UPPER(politicians.first_name), 1, 1) = SUBSTR(UPPER(inmates.first_name), 1, 1)
      AND  UPPER(politicians.last_name) = UPPER(inmates.last_name)
      AND inmates.birth_year = politicians.birth_year 
      
WHERE politicians.service_start > inmates.sentence_end;
~~~


### The politicians who spent the most time in jail?


### The inmates who spent the most time in politics?


### The politician-turned-inmate who had the quickest transition into prison life?

### The inmate-turned-politician who had the longest wait before being elected?
